# Information on AI in Warfare

## Opportunities

- computing large amounts of data quickly
- perform human tasks without deploying personell
- optimize procedures
- helping monitor and secure borders

## Risks

- Vulnerable to Cyberattacks and manipulation
- limited computing on field, if used in vehicles
- depends strongly on infrastructure outside of vehicles
- Deepfakes and impersonation

## Perspectives

### Germany

- Is currently being researched in a specialized AI-Laboratory
- Partially used in Tanks and Anti-Aircraft Emplacements
- may be used determining optimal routes for cars and planes

### Pakistan

- may be used in border security and counter terrorism
- may be help detect propaganda, extremist content and cyber threats
- Danger comes from non-state actors implementing AI, even if they are not very developed yet
- Already used for propaganda and in drones for surveillance and small-scale attacks

## Imaginary Scenario

- Two Countries at war
- apart from physical fighting, the fight is also fought online
- Deepfakes and impersonations through AI created by both countries aim to destabilize the other
- there are cyberattacks all the time, aiming for data used by AI and the AIs themselfes, trying to infilitrate and manipulate the enemy
- Every bit of information is used against the other, even dragging citizens into it
- All fueled by AI unleashed in the Internet, enabling this kind of involvement
- Information turns into the most valuable ressource and the strongest weapon, and the battlefield is everywhere
