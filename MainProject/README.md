## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an intelligent CSP solver for **Zebra Logic Puzzles** (also known as Einstein's Riddle or Logic Grid Puzzles). The solver can:

- **Parse** natural language puzzle descriptions into formal CSP representations
- **Solve** puzzles of varying complexity (2x2 to 6x6 grids and beyond)
- **Optimize** search using MRV heuristic, forward checking, and arc consistency (AC-3)
- **Generate** structured outputs for automated evaluation

Developed for the **AI Connect 2025** international competition involving HSBI (Germany), TDU (Türkiye), SEECS/NUST (Pakistan), and CST/RUB (Bhutan).

## 🧩 Problem Statement

**What is a Zebra Puzzle?**

A logic grid puzzle where you must deduce assignments between entities based on clues. 

**Example:**
```
There are 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3 from left to right.
- Colors: red, blue, green
- Names: Alice, Bob, Carol
- Pets: cat, dog, fish

Clues:
1. Alice lives in the first house.
2. The person in the red house owns a cat.
3. Bob is directly left of Carol.
4. The green house is not in house 3.
```

**Goal:** Determine which person lives in which house with which color and pet.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pandas library

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TCChris205/AIConnect.git
   cd AIConnect/MainProject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas pyarrow
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python solver.py --help
   ```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Solver on Test Dataset

```bash
python solver.py
```

This will:
1. Load puzzles from `Test_100_Puzzles.parquet`
2. Solve each puzzle using CSP backtracking
3. Generate `submission.csv` with results
4. Print accuracy and efficiency statistics

### Run on Custom Dataset

```python
from solver import solve_puzzle, puzzle_text_to_csp

puzzle_text = """
There are 3 houses.
- Name: Alice, Bob, Carol
- Color: red, blue, green

Clues:
1. Alice is in the first house.
2. Bob is in the red house.
"""

# Parse puzzle into CSP format
csp = puzzle_text_to_csp(puzzle_text)

# Solve
solution, stats = solve_puzzle(csp)

print(f"Solution: {solution}")
print(f"Nodes explored: {stats.nodes_explored}")
```

## 🔬 How It Works

### CSP Modeling

Our solver represents puzzles as Constraint Satisfaction Problems:

#### **Variables**
Each attribute-value pair (e.g., `("name", "Alice")`) is a variable.

#### **Domains**
Each variable can be assigned to house positions 1 to *n* (where *n* = number of houses).

#### **Constraints**
Clues are parsed into constraint types:

| Constraint Type | Example Clue | Formal Representation |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Unary** | "Alice is in house 1" | `position(Alice) = 1` |
| **Binary Equality** | "Alice owns the cat" | `position(Alice) = position(cat)` |
| **Binary Inequality** | "Bob is not in house 2" | `position(Bob) ≠ 2` |
| **Relative Position** | "Alice is left of Bob" | `position(Alice) < position(Bob)` |
| **Adjacent** | "Alice is next to Bob" | `|position(Alice) - position(Bob)| = 1` |
| **Distance** | "Two houses between Alice and Bob" | `|position(Alice) - position(Bob)| = 3` |

**Example:**
```
Variables: {("name", "Alice"), ("name", "Bob"), ("color", "red"), ("pet", "cat")}
Domains: {1, 2, 3} for each variable
Constraints: [
  ("=", ("name", "Alice"), 1),           # Alice in house 1
  ("=", ("name", "Bob"), ("color", "red")), # Bob in red house
]
```

### Natural Language Parser

The parser converts puzzle text into CSP format through several stages:

#### **1. Description Parsing**
- Extracts number of houses: `"There are 3 houses"` → `houses = 3`
- Identifies dimensions and domains:
  ```
  "- Name: Alice, Bob, Carol" → {"name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]}
  ```

#### **2. Clue Extraction**
- Identifies numbered clues using regex patterns
- Handles multi-line clues
- Normalizes text (lowercase, remove apostrophes, etc.)

#### **3. Constraint Generation**
Recognizes patterns in clues:

```python
"Alice is in the first house" → Unary constraint: (Alice, position 1)
"directly left of" → Adjacent constraint with order
"somewhere to the left of" → Less-than constraint
"next to each other" → Adjacency constraint
"one house between" → Distance constraint (distance = 2)
```

#### **4. Value Indexing**
- Builds lookup table: normalized text → attribute references
- Handles variations: "knitting" → "knit", "photography" → "photograph"

### Solver Algorithm

Our solver uses **backtracking search** with three key optimizations:

#### **1. MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) Heuristic**
- Selects the variable with the fewest legal values first
- Reduces branching factor early in the search
- "Fail-first" principle: detect inconsistencies sooner

```python
def select_variable(domains):
    return min(unassigned_variables, 
               key=lambda v: len(domains[v]))
```

#### **2. Forward Checking**
- After each assignment, prune inconsistent values from neighboring variables
- Immediate detection of dead-ends
- Significantly reduces search space

```python
def forward_check(assignment, var, value):
    for neighbor in get_constrained_neighbors(var):
        remove_inconsistent_values(neighbor, var, value)
```

#### **3. Arc Consistency (AC-3)**
- Ensures binary constraints are satisfied throughout the search
- Propagates constraints transitively
- More thorough than forward checking alone

```python
def ac3(domains, constraints):
    queue = all_arcs_from_constraints()
    while queue:
        (xi, xj) = queue.pop()
        if revise(xi, xj):
            queue.extend(all_arcs_to(xi))
```

#### **Search Process**

1. **Initialize**: All variables have full domains {1, 2, ..., n}
2. **Select Variable**: Choose variable with minimum remaining values (MRV)
3. **Try Values**: For each value in domain:
   - Assign value to variable
   - Apply forward checking
   - Apply AC-3 for constraint propagation
   - If consistent, recurse
   - If dead-end, backtrack
4. **Solution Found**: When all variables are assigned consistently

**Example Trace:**
```
Initial State: All domains = {1, 2, 3}

Assign Alice = 1 (from clue)
→ Forward check: All other variables ≠ 1

Assign Bob = ? (MRV selects Bob, domain = {2, 3})
→ Try Bob = 2
→ Forward check on constraints...
→ Success! Continue...

Solution: {Alice: 1, Bob: 2, Carol: 3, ...}
```
