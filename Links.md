- Integration of AI into the Bundeswehr is currently being researched
- Specialized AI-Laboratory in the batallion for electronic warfare
- Primarily used as a way to analyse big amounts of data quickly

Presented applications:

- determining optimal routes for cars and planes
- Probably many use cases beyond that

Important Points:

- Assurance of correctness and integrity of used data
- Cybersecurity and protection from manipulation
- Interconnectivity within the military and adaptability to different hardwares and situations
- reliability and persistence
- human control of results -> supervised learning
- limited computational ressources on field

## Germany

### Current Situation

- Is currently being researched in a specialized AI-Laboratory
- Partially used in Tanks and Anti-Aircraft Emplacements
- may be used determining optimal routes for cars and planes

### Pros

- computing large amounts of data quickly
- perform human tasks without deploying personell
- optimize procedures

### Contras

- Vulnerable to Cyberattacks and manipulation
- limited computing on field, if used in vehicles
- depends strongly on infrastructure outside of vehicles
